     * This mode is basically the same as

     *
     * <p>A wild object is an object with neither
     * {@link org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.Id} nor
     * {@link org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.Key}.
     * The difference between this mode and the
     * {@link #UPSERT} mode is as follows:</p>
     *
     * <ul>
     *     <li>{@code UPSERT}: Considers wild
     *     objects illegal, throws
     *     {@link SaveException.NeitherIdNorKey}</li>
     *     <li>{@code NON_IDEMPOTENT_UPSERT}:
     *     Ignores the risk of breaking idempotency
     *     and unconditionally inserts wild objects.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>This mode is actually similar to the
     * `{@code saveOrUpdate}` in other frameworks,
     * so most developers are very familiar with it.
     * However, Jimmer does not recommend this mode
     * because it is really not a good idea.</p>
